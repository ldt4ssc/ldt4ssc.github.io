### Work Strands Overview

The pilots are organized across three interconnected work strands, each addressing different aspects of Local Digital Twin development:

!!! abstract "WS1: Technical Interconnection of LDTs"
    **Linking and scaling digital twins that are already in place**

    Pilots focusing on connecting and integrating existing Local Digital Twin infrastructures to enable data sharing and interoperability across communities.

!!! abstract "WS2: Creation of LDTs Based on Common Needs"
    **Addressing shared urban or regional challenges (e.g., cross-border traffic, air pollution)**

    Pilots developing new Local Digital Twins that address shared challenges and requirements across multiple communities.

!!! abstract "WS3: Adding New Advanced AI-Based Tools to existing LDTs"
    **Integrating AI-driven, value-added services to enhance existing LDTs and new services to the LDTs Toolbox**

    Pilots integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into Local Digital Twin systems for enhanced decision-making.

## Progress Tracker

All pilots deliver five key outputs throughout their 12–18 month journey:

| Deliverable | Description | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **PD1** | Data Management Plan & Ethics | M1–M2 |
| **PD2** | Interoperability Self-Assessment | M1–M2 & Final |
| **PD3** | Pilot Scope & Architecture | TBD |
| **PD4** | Governance Scheme | TBD |
| **PD5** | Communication & Exploitation Report | TBD |
