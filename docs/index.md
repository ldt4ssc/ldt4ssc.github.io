# Welcome to LTD4SCC Knowledge Hub!

The **LDT4SSC Knowledge Base Inventory (KB)** is the central reference hub of the project *Local Digital Twins for Smart and Sustainable Communities (LDT4SSC)*.  
It collects and organises the project’s knowledge outputs, providing stakeholders with easy access to strategies, tools, guidance, and pilots.

## Why it is important  

The Knowledge Base is more than a repository — it is a cornerstone of the project’s **strategy and sustainability vision**. By consolidating all resources in one place, it:  

- ✅ **Supports strategic alignment** by documenting the project’s mission, vision, impact assessment framework, and sustainability approach.  
- 🤝 **Facilitates community building** by connecting to major European initiatives such as *Living-in.EU, the EU LDT Toolbox, DS4SSCC, CitCom.ai,* and *SIMPL.*  
- 🔗 **Strengthens interoperability and innovation** by making requirements, specifications, and use cases openly available.  
- 🚀 **Empowers pilots and stakeholders** by providing guidance, technical recommendations, and showcasing demonstrators.  
- 🔍 **Ensures transparency and reuse** so that outputs can extend beyond the project’s lifetime.
