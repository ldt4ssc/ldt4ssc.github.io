# WS3 Piloting Activities - Adding New AI-Based Tools to the LDTs Toolbox

## Brief Overview  
This Work Strand is about experimenting with advanced AI-based services to push the boundaries of what Local Digital Twins (LDTs) can do. Pilots will test and apply cutting-edge approaches such as generative AI (GenAI4EU), virtual worlds, advanced simulation and modelling, and multi-sector services. These solutions will help cities improve critical services (energy, mobility, infrastructure, risk management) while involving citizens more actively in shaping their communities.  

**Key facts:**  
- 3–4 pilots will be selected  
- Start of the pilots: May/November 2026  
- Duration: 18 months  
- Funding: 50% co-funding required  
- Opening of Open Call 4: February 2026  
- Opening of Open Call 5: May 2026  

**What is the goal?**  
- Pilot AI-driven use cases that go beyond current LDT capabilities.  
- Test novel applications using generative AI, simulation, and immersive technologies.  
- Strengthen citizen participation through co-creation and democratic engagement.  
- Ensure that both advanced and less advanced communities can benefit from new AI tools.

**Who Are We Looking For?**  

We invite applications from:  
- Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regions, syndicates which already have a **public service** (whichever) and want to experiment with AI-enhanced LDT services to improve public services and resilience.  
- Cities, municipalities, or regions.  
- Technology innovators and solution providers in areas such as AI, generative AI, Citiverse/virtual worlds, simulation, and modelling, who are ready to collaborate with cities and transfer their solutions into real-world pilots.  

**Minimum consortium composition:**  
- At least 2 public entities  
- Plus 1 other partner from the following:  
  - Private entity (e.g., service provider)  
  - Private association (legal status)  
  - Trusted third party  
  - Representative of a use-case sector  

**Requirement:**  
- The consortium must propose at least 2 common use cases.

## WS3 Specific Requirements  

On top of the **common requirements** described in the Pilot Guidance page, WS3 piloting activity extends its requirements to:  

**General**  
- The pilot must specify how AI will be integrated into their data processing.  
- The pilot must comply with European regulations such as the **AI Act**, especially regarding **data governance** at the project level.  
- The pilot guarantees **transparency towards end-users** in the use of AI through an ethical charter/code of ethics, or other means.  

**Technical**  
- The pilots must use a **software tool (to be provided)** to assess their **carbon footprint impact** of the developed AI models.  
- The pilot shall build a **business knowledge model** of their smart data model.  
- Pilots must prove that, through the use of AI, they have become **more efficient and consume less**, notably because of structured data with completed levels of relationships.  

**Recommendation**  
To ensure usefulness, efficiency, and relevance of AI in the project, pilots should base themselves on their own **publications/articles/papers**, or on **key publications in their field** (e.g., if the topic is about how mobility is decarbonised, they should base themselves on expert opinions, feedbacks from experiments, etc.), which should lead to them building a very innovative project.
