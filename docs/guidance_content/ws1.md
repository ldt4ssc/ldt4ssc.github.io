## WS1 Resources  

This section provides a set of **non-technical** and **technical resources** that are directly targeted to the WS1 scope. These resources are designed to support pilots in preparing their proposals, planning their implementation, and ensuring compliance with interoperability and governance requirements.  

Pilots will find these materials extremely relevant, as they provide practical guidance and concrete examples to help them understand what they need to do at each stage of the process. By using these resources, pilots can ensure that their projects are well aligned with the objectives of WS1 and contribute effectively to the broader European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.
