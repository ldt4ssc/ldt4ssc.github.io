# WS1 Piloting Activities - Technical Inter-connection of Existing LDTs

## Brief Overview  
This Work Strand focuses on connecting and testing existing Local Digital Twins (LDTs) within a European ecosystem. The aim is to demonstrate interoperability, enable cross-domain and cross-border data sharing, and build the foundations for a European federation of LDTs. Through these efforts, the pilots will unlock innovation opportunities for cities, communities, and providers, contributing to smarter and more resilient communities across Europe.

- 6–8 pilots will be selected

- Start of the pilots: May 2026

- Duration: 18 months

- Funding: 50% co-funding required

- Opening of Open Call 1: November 2025

## Who are we looking for?  

**Municipalities, groups of municipalities, syndicates, or regions** with:  
  - A data platform with a description and a functional perimeter  
  - Willingness to share data, models, and services with:  
    - Other data platforms (LDT, hypervision, etc.)  
    - Data spaces  

**Municipalities or regions** wanting to create a **data space** to link a batch of local data platforms  

**Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regions** aiming to create a **marketplace of services**

## WS1 Mandatory Requirements  
To ensure that selected pilots are mature, interoperable, and sustainable, applicants must comply with a set of **mandatory requirements**. These requirements cover technical, legal, and governance aspects, ensuring that pilots contribute effectively to the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem and are well alligned with the scope and goals of this Work Strand.  

**Technical Requirements**

- The pilot demonstrates sufficient *digital maturity* (TBD)
- Interoperability is integrated *by design*, not as an afterthought (TBD)
- Applicants commit to adopting a *high level of interoperability*, aligned with MIMs and linked legal clauses (TBD)

**Legal Requirements**

- Agreement to integrate *legal clauses* ensuring data sovereignty, compliance with funded projects, and replicability of results  
- A clear statement of *data governance status* must be provided at both the beginning and the end of the project  
- A *minimum governance baseline* must be described to enable project start  
- Proposal of a *methodology for establishing data governance frameworks* tailored to the pilot

## WS1 Resources  

This section provides a set of **non-technical** and **technical resources** that are directly targeted to the WS1 scope. These resources are designed to support pilots in preparing their proposals, planning their implementation, and ensuring compliance with interoperability and governance requirements.  

Pilots will find these materials extremely relevant, as they provide practical guidance and concrete examples to help them understand what they need to do at each stage of the process. By using these resources, pilots can ensure that their projects are well aligned with the objectives of WS1 and contribute effectively to the broader European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.
