# WS1 Piloting Activities - Technical Inter-connection of Existing LDTs

## Brief Overview  
This Work Strand focuses on connecting and testing existing Local Digital Twins (LDTs) within a European ecosystem. The goal is to demonstrate interoperability, enable data sharing across domains and borders, and unlock new opportunities for smarter and more resilient communities.  

**Key facts:**  
- 6–8 pilots will be selected  
- Start of the pilots: May 2026  
- Duration: 18 months  
- Funding: 50% co-funding required  
- Opening of Open Call 1: November 2025  

**What is the goal?**  
- Demonstrate interoperability between existing LDTs  
- Enable cross-domain and cross-border data sharing  
- Build the foundations for a European federation of LDTs  
- Unlock innovation opportunities for cities, communities, and providers

**Who Are We Looking For?**  

Municipalities, groups of municipalities, syndicates, or regions, who have a **data platform** with a description and a functional perimeter, and who are willing to share data, models, and services with:  
- Other data platforms (LDT, hypervision, etc.)  
- Data spaces  

Municipalities or regions aiming to:  
- Create a data space to link a batch of local data platforms  
- Develop a marketplace of services  

**Minimum consortium composition:**  
- At least 2 public entities  
- Plus 1 other partner from the following:  
  - Private entity (e.g., service provider)  
  - Private association (legal status)  
  - Trusted third party  
  - Representative of a use-case sector  

**Requirement:**  
- The consortium must propose at least 2 common use cases.

## WS1 Specific Requirements  

On top of the **common requirements** described in the Pilot Guidance page, WS1 piloting activity extends its requirements to:  

**Technical**  
- The pilot consortium must include at least **two data platforms/Local Digital Twins** to interconnect (upcoming definitions).  
- Applicants must use in priority the **proposed building blocks and assets** (smart data models, connectors, etc.) to interconnect their platforms or LDTs.  
- Pilots must use **selected types of interconnection** (TBD).  
- For knowledge models:  
  - Use existing smart data models, or  
  - Create new smart data models if they don’t exist.  
- Applicants must agree to **publish on GitHub, FIWARE, or EDIC** (TBD)

## WS1 Resources  

This section provides a set of **non-technical** and **technical resources** that are directly targeted to the WS1 scope. These resources are designed to support pilots in preparing their proposals, planning their implementation, and ensuring compliance with interoperability and governance requirements.  

Pilots will find these materials extremely relevant, as they provide practical guidance and concrete examples to help them understand what they need to do at each stage of the process. By using these resources, pilots can ensure that their projects are well aligned with the objectives of WS1 and contribute effectively to the broader European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.
