# Strategy & Sustainability

Local digital twins (LDTs) should be developed through a purpose-driven, collaborative approach that addresses real community needs, scales beyond pilots, and remains sustainable in the long term. 

Municipalities are expected to begin their LDT development by defining clear local objectives (e.g. climate resilience, mobility, or public health goals), validating these with stakeholders, and building the digital twin around concrete use cases. Incremental expansion of services and applications, guided by a coherent strategy and supported by an interoperable technical backbone, enables communities to create and capture value throughout the ongoing development process. To ensure accountability and shared learning, the value of LDTs should be measured against well-defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) linked to the original goals, with results (both successes and setbacks) communicated across current stakeholders and potential collaborators. 

As with any digital transformation journey, trust and value creation are essential. Governance should therefore engage diverse stakeholders across the quadruple helix (public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society), supported by strong leadership to align digital infrastructure and data-driven collaboration with community-wide strategies. This requires fostering public–private–people partnerships (PPPPs) under robust governance frameworks that clearly define roles, responsibilities, value distribution, and mechanisms for long-term financial sustainability. 

Long-term viability also depends on maintaining an open and interoperable ecosystem for data and services. Cities and their partners should establish strong data governance mechanisms and adopt open standards, modular architectures, and federated systems to avoid vendor lock-in. LDTs must also remain adaptable, evolving over time by integrating open-source toolboxes and emerging technologies such as AI. Hence, close collaboration with wider European initiatives, including the EU LDT Toolbox, data spaces, Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs), and AI Factories, is essential to sustain innovation and growth.

## Mission, Vision & Values  

**Mission:**


To build a robust, scalable, and interoperable ecosystem of Local Digital Twins (LDTs) across Europe, empowering communities with digital twin capabilities and AI-driven tools to optimise urban services, foster innovation, and tackle pressing challenges such as climate change, environmental, economic and social sustainability, and digital transformation. 

**Vision:**


The LDT4SSC contributes to the broader vision for a resilient, inclusive, and interconnected European digital landscape where interoperable local digital twins drive sustainable urban development, support the twin green and digital transitions, and strengthen Europe’s competitiveness, autonomy, and societal well-being. The initiative aims to support the LDT CitiVERSE EDICs efforts in the development of interoperable digital infrastructure across the European Union, foster economies of scale and enable cross-border collaboration among the LDT ecosystem contributing to Europe’s Digital Decade’s Digital Compass 2030 targets and Green Deal objectives.



**Values:**


- **Sustainability through innovation and openness**: advancing economic, environmental and social sustainability by fostering the adoption of open standards, boosting data-sharing, and supporting fair competition to stimulate AI and LDT-based services.

- **Inclusiveness, Collaboration & Co-creation**: bridging the digital divide and ensuring accessibility for communities of all sizes and levels of maturity by making LDT services widely available as well as fostering cross-border, cross-sectoral partnerships through the quadruple helix model (public, private, academia, civil society).

- **Resilience & Competitiveness**: strengthening Europe’s digital sovereignty and reducing reliance on foreign technologies, while staying focused on enhancing citizens’ quality of life.

- **Trust & Ethics**: promoting privacy, security, compliance with EU regulations, and ethical AI use that is economically viable and societally sustainable.

## Unique Value Propositions  

- **Municipalities**: LDTs offer city and county governments a powerful decision-support tool. Furthermore, by simulating “what-if” scenarios, planners can optimise services and infrastructure (e.g., transportation layouts, flood defences or energy grids) before costly real-world changes. Overall, cities gain evidence-based policy insights, better cross-department coordination and a way to meet sustainability targets, improving citizens’ quality of life and urban resilience.  

- **Citizens**: LDTs make urban governance more transparent and inclusive by visualising both current urban conditions and future plans (e.g., a new park or transit system). This helps residents understand how proposed developments might affect the city and their daily lives, encouraging them to provide feedback and co-create with the urban designers. Moreover, when cities align the digital twin with public values and involve communities early on, they build trust and ensure the technology serves the public good.  

- **Civil Society Organizations**: When made available to the public, NGOs and community groups gain a powerful data-based tool for advocacy and collaboration with local governments and citizens. CSOs can monitor policy impacts (e.g., on the environment, social equity, accessibility), raise issues early, and work jointly on solutions.  

- **Technology Providers**: Municipalities often procure the provision or development of LDTs from tech firms, such as software developers, platform vendors, sensor manufacturers, etc. In turn, this provides the companies with new markets and collaboration channels, helping them to demonstrate their technology in a real urban setting, refine with city data, and build a business case (via demonstrated ROI and environmental impact) for their offerings. Furthermore, when engaged in offering open-source and interoperable solutions through EU initiatives such as the LDT Toolbox, tech providers can position themselves as a trustworthy vendor for interoperable services, following EU standards and principles.  

- **SMEs and Industry**: Small and medium enterprises, and industry stakeholders (e.g., logistics, construction, energy) are essential for a thriving urban ecosystem, and private-public collaboration has several opportunities. LDTs can provide companies with practical and varied benefits, depending on context. E.g., utility companies may integrate their data into the LDT to improve maintenance and design. Freight operators, on the other hand, may be able to optimise last-mile delivery routes and experiment with low-emission vehicles, yielding cost and emission reductions. Cities may act as relevant testbeds for service providers, by engaging and integrating with the LDTs for mutual benefit.  

- **Research Organisations**: LDTs provide universities and think-tanks with a promising experimental platform, helping researchers to test hypotheses, validate models and develop new analytics by feeding their simulations with real urban data (based on governed access and use). Similarly, academia is a critical stakeholder for fostering innovation ecosystems and capacity-building, helping communities integrate research findings into policy and urban development.
