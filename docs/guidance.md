# Pilot Guidance

## General Guidance
This section provides an overview of the piloting process within LDT4SSC and offers guidance and relevant resources for each of the Work Strands.  

**Why to apply?**  
Pilots are at the heart of LDT4SSC. They enable real-world testing of data-processing through digital twin solutions, interconnection of digital twins requiring data spaces processes, validate interoperability, and deliver tangible benefits for communities. Selected pilots will receive:  

- Funding support.  
- Technical & non-technical guidance.  
- Increased visibility across the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.  

**Who should apply?**  
LDT4SSC pilots are open to a wide range of stakeholders, including:  

- Cities, municipalities, provincial, regional authorities/governments  
- Syndicates and energy communities  
- Technology providers and AI innovators from the private and public sector

**Work Strands (WS):**  
The project foresees **three Work Strands** through which potential pilots can apply to receive funding and develop their solutions:  

- **WS1: Technical Inter-connection of Data Platforms (Existing LDTs, Hypervisors, …)** – Linking and scaling digital twins or data platforms that are already in place  
- **WS2: Creation of LDTs Based on Common Needs** – Addressing shared urban or regional challenges (e.g., cross-border traffic, air pollution).  
- **WS3: Adding New Advanced AI-Based Tools to existing LDTs** – Integrating AI-driven, value-added services to enhance existing LDTs and new services to the LDTs Toolbox.

## Common Requirements

All calls will include a set of **common requirements** that applicants must meet in order to ensure the quality, interoperability, and sustainability of the pilots. These requirements are divided into **technical**, **non-technical**, and **general**.  

**Technical:**  
1. The pilot demonstrates sufficient digital maturity (self-assessment survey).  
2. The pilot integrates interoperability by design from the start (not as an after-thought).  
3. Applicants commit to adopting a high level of interoperability, aligned with Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) Plus.  
4. Agree to use the global methodology for pilot implementation, and to adapt it to their project.  

**Non-Technical:**  

<u>Financial:</u>  
5. Pilot applicants will have to cover **half of the project budget**.  

<u>Legal / Governance:</u>  

<ol start="6">
  <li>To ensure interoperability by design:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Applicants must agree to integrate legal clauses regarding data sovereignty, the project being partly publicly funded, and the replicability and sustainability of results.</li>
      <li>Pilots will have a consortium agreement between entities.</li>
      <li>Pilot uses legal clauses with their partners/subcontracting.</li>
      <li>A clear description of data governance status must be provided at both the beginning and the end of the project:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Pilots will have to describe the current state of their data governance and the data governance they plan to achieve at the end of the project.</li>
          <li>Pilots will have to explain their methodology for implementing their data governance.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Pilots must agree to share part of the project’s produced assets (e.g., data models, knowledge models, legal contracts, dashboards, visualisations, useful types of data, algorithms used to build dashboards, etc.).</li>
</ol>  

**General:**  
8. The pilot consortium has familiarised themselves with the *priority areas of the European Green Deal* and *New European Bauhaus*; the project’s use cases align with them.  
9. Pilots must agree to *measure their socio-economic and environmental impact*; results will not be discriminatory for the project.  
10. The pilot follows a *cost-benefit analysis* with the provided tried-and-tested framework.  
11. *End-users are involved* from conception to roll-out (e.g., workshops or other means). The principles of the quadruple helix (collaborative innovation model involving all stakeholders) are integrated into the end-user engagement practices of the project.  
12. The project has clear *positioning* regarding its *added value to the LDT4SSC ecosystem*.  
13. The pilot maintains *regular documentation, feedback, and updates* to the LDT4SSC consortium, contributing to a *common project Knowledge Hub*.  
14. The pilot follows the *LDT4SSC global methodology* and adapts it to their project—many methodological steps are to be followed for long-term sustainability (project-wise and environmentally-friendly) and reproducibility.  
15. In a European project about *digitalisation and sustainability*, pilots agree to *constantly question their reasoning*, asking “*what do I truly need for my use case—and to be frugal?*” at each new step.  
16. If you are using AI, refer to the specific AI methods on WS3.  

**Recommendations (Will Be Advantaged):**  
- Pilots who follow *eco-design guidelines* for the design of their platforms and services.  
- Pilots who *favour open access* to share the created *Key Expected Outcomes (services and assets)* of their projects.  
- Pilots who *involve public entities from multiple Member States*, enabling cross-border collaboration.
