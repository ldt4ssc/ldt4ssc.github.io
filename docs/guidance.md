# Pilot Guidance


## General Guidance
This section provides an overview of the piloting process within **LDT4SSC** and provides guidelines and relevant resources for each of the Work Strands.

**Why to apply?**  
  Pilots are at the heart of LDT4SSC. They enable real-world testing of digital twin solutions, validate interoperability, and deliver tangible benefits for communities. Selected pilots will receive funding, technical and non-technical support, and visibility across the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.  

**Work Strands (WS):**  
  The project foresees **three Work Strands**:  
  - **WS1: Technical Inter-connection of Existing LDTs** â€“ linking and scaling digital twins already in place.  
  - **WS2:  Creation of LDTs Based on Common Needs** â€“ addressing shared urban or regional challenges (e.g. cross-border traffic, pollution).  
  - **WS3: Adding New Advanced AI-Based Tools to the LDTs Toolbox** â€“ adding AI-driven, value-added services to enhance LDTs.

## Piloting Work Strand 1

### Brief Overview
**What is the goal?**  
This work strand focuses on connecting and testing **existing Local Digital Twins (LDTs)** within a European ecosystem. The aim is to demonstrate interoperability, enable data sharing across domains and borders, and unlock new opportunities for smarter and more resilient communities.  

**Who are we looking for?**  
We are seeking **cities and communities that already have a digital twin** and are ready to:  
- Integrate it with a European LDT infrastructure  
- Test interoperability and cross-community data exchange  
- Share lessons learned and scalable practices  

**Why apply?**  
- Join the **European LDT ecosystem** and collaborate with peers  
- Showcase and scale your **digital twin solutions** across regions  
- Access shared methodologies, tools, and expertise  
- Strengthen your cityâ€™s role as a **leader in innovation and resilience**
