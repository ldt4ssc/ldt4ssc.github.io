# Pilot Guidance

## General Guidance
This section provides an overview of the piloting process within LDT4SSC and offers guidance and relevant resources for each of the Work Strands.  

**Why to apply?**  
Pilots are at the heart of LDT4SSC. They enable real-world testing of data-processing through digital twin solutions, interconnection of digital twins requiring data spaces processes, validate interoperability, and deliver tangible benefits for communities. Selected pilots will receive:  

- Funding support.  
- Technical & non-technical guidance.  
- Increased visibility across the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.  

**Who should apply?**  
LDT4SSC pilots are open to a wide range of stakeholders, including:  

- Cities, municipalities, provincial, regional authorities/governments  
- Syndicates and energy communities  
- Technology providers and AI innovators from the private and public sector

Rq15. For each use case, provide two draft diagrams:
1. Technical architecture (LDT interconnection)
2. Functional architecture (data lifecycle)
Rq16. Describe how shared data models and Linked Data ontologies (MIM1) will ensure semantic interoperability (e.g., NGSI-LD, RDF, SPARQL).
Rq17. Specify the data, assets, and services to be shared, sectors involved, providers, and beneficiaries.
Rq18. Identify which MIMs Plus (MIM0–MIM8) the project will use, level of current and planned compliance, and justification.
Pilots must engage with at least the five foundational MIMs Plus.

**Impact**
Rq19. Explain the rationale and ambition for interconnecting LDTs and how shared data/services enhance governance, efficiency, and innovation.
Rq20. Describe the expected benefits and long-term impacts for participating communities, including measurable indicators.
Rq21. Describe wider socio-economic and environmental indirect effects, and how eco-design contributes to sustainability.
Rq22. Ensure a contractual framework that guarantees sustainability of digital twins (rights to use data, IP, analyses, exploitation rights, etc.).
Rq23. Describe the expected outputs (services, tools, data models, assets) and their post-pilot openness (Open Source, Limited Access, Proprietary).
Data models must be published under an open licence; services should be shared via the LDT Toolbox Marketplace.
Pilots must maintain regular documentation for the Knowledge Hub.
Rq24. Define a strategy for sustaining and scaling services beyond the project.

## Recommendations
Rc1. Provide LORDIMAS digital maturity scores.
Pilot lead: recommended Digitally Optimised; other authorities: at least Moderate at application, and Digitally Optimised by project end.
Rc2. Use open-source components and contribute enhancements back to the community.
Rc3. Include non-exclusive IP/knowledge transfer provisions and clear rules for rights protection and sharing.
Rc4. Establish:
- A DCAT-based data catalogue
- A context broker or system supporting JSON-LD/RDF/NGSI-LD
- An IAM system based on OAuth2, OIDC, or Verifiable Credentials
- An ODRL-based data policy
Rc5. Seek alignment with the LDT Toolbox as specifications become available.
Rc6. Describe compliance with frameworks: Gaia-X Trust Framework, IDSA, DSBA Recommendations, DSSC Blueprint, DS4SSCC-DEP Blueprint.
Rc7. Record all baseline data (socio-economic, environmental, organisational) before starting, to enable a robust final Cost–Benefit analysis.
Rc8. Assess eco-design maturity using the General Policy Framework for the Ecodesign of Digital Services (2024) at the beginning and end of the project (at least the top 30 criteria).

<!-- START Commenting out requirements
All calls will include a set of **common requirements** that applicants must meet in order to ensure the quality, interoperability, and sustainability of the pilots. These requirements are divided into **technical**, **non-technical**, and **general**.  

**Technical:**  
1. The pilot demonstrates sufficient digital maturity (self-assessment survey).  
2. The pilot integrates interoperability by design from the start (not as an after-thought).  
3. Applicants commit to adopting a high level of interoperability, aligned with Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) Plus.  
4. Agree to use the global methodology for pilot implementation, and to adapt it to their project.  

**Non-Technical:**  

<u>Financial:</u>  
5. Pilot applicants will have to cover **half of the project budget**.  

<u>Legal / Governance:</u>  

<ol start="6">
  <li>To ensure interoperability by design:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Applicants must agree to integrate legal clauses regarding data sovereignty, the project being partly publicly funded, and the replicability and sustainability of results.</li>
      <li>Pilots will have a consortium agreement between entities.</li>
      <li>Pilot uses legal clauses with their partners/subcontracting.</li>
      <li>A clear description of data governance status must be provided at both the beginning and the end of the project:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Pilots will have to describe the current state of their data governance and the data governance they plan to achieve at the end of the project.</li>
          <li>Pilots will have to explain their methodology for implementing their data governance.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Pilots must agree to share part of the project’s produced assets (e.g., data models, knowledge models, legal contracts, dashboards, visualisations, useful types of data, algorithms used to build dashboards, etc.).</li>
</ol>  

**General:**  
8. The pilot consortium has familiarised themselves with the *priority areas of the European Green Deal* and *New European Bauhaus*; the project’s use cases align with them.  
9. Pilots must agree to *measure their socio-economic and environmental impact*; results will not be discriminatory for the project.  
10. The pilot follows a *cost-benefit analysis* with the provided tried-and-tested framework.  
11. *End-users are involved* from conception to roll-out (e.g., workshops or other means). The principles of the quadruple helix (collaborative innovation model involving all stakeholders) are integrated into the end-user engagement practices of the project.  
12. The project has clear *positioning* regarding its *added value to the LDT4SSC ecosystem*.  
13. The pilot maintains *regular documentation, feedback, and updates* to the LDT4SSC consortium, contributing to a *common project Knowledge Hub*.  
14. The pilot follows the *LDT4SSC global methodology* and adapts it to their project—many methodological steps are to be followed for long-term sustainability (project-wise and environmentally-friendly) and reproducibility.  
15. In a European project about *digitalisation and sustainability*, pilots agree to *constantly question their reasoning*, asking “*what do I truly need for my use case—and to be frugal?*” at each new step.  
16. If you are using AI, refer to the specific AI methods on WS3.  

**Recommendations (Will Be Advantaged):**  
- Pilots who follow *eco-design guidelines* for the design of their platforms and services.  
- Pilots who *favour open access* to share the created *Key Expected Outcomes (services and assets)* of their projects.  
- Pilots who *involve public entities from multiple Member States*, enabling cross-border collaboration.
