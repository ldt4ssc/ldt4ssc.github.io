# Pilot Guidance


## General Guidance
This section provides an overview of the piloting process within LDT4SSC and offers guidance and relevant resources for each of the Work Strands.


**Why to apply?**  
Pilots are at the heart of LDT4SSC. They enable real-world testing of digital twin solutions, validate interoperability, and deliver tangible benefits for communities. Selected pilots will receive:

 - Funding support. 
 - Technical & non-technical guidance. 
 - Increased visibility across the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem. 


**Who should apply?**  
LDT4SSC pilots are open to a wide range of stakeholders, including:

 - Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regions 
 - Syndicates and energy communities
 - Technology providers and AI innovators from the private and public sector


--- 

**Work Strands (WS):**  
The project foresees **three Work Strands** through which potential pilots can apply to receive funding and develop their solutions:

  - **WS1: Technical Inter-connection of Existing LDTs** – linking and scaling digital twins already in place.  
  - **WS2:  Creation of LDTs Based on Common Needs** – addressing shared urban or regional challenges (e.g. cross-border traffic, pollution).  
  - **WS3: Adding New Advanced AI-Based Tools to the LDTs Toolbox** – adding AI-driven, value-added services to enhance LDTs.
