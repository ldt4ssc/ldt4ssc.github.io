# Pilot Guidance


## General Guidance
This section provides an overview of the piloting process within LDT4SSC and offers guidance and relevant resources for each of the Work Strands.


**Why to apply?**  
Pilots are at the heart of LDT4SSC. They enable real-world testing of digital twin solutions, validate interoperability, and deliver tangible benefits for communities. Selected pilots will receive:

 - Funding support. 
 - Technical & non-technical guidance. 
 - Increased visibility across the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem. 


**Who should apply?**  
LDT4SSC pilots are open to a wide range of stakeholders, including:

 - Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regions 
 - Syndicates and energy communities
 - Technology providers and AI innovators from the private and public sector


--- 

**Work Strands (WS):**  
The project foresees **three Work Strands** through which potential pilots can apply to receive funding and develop their solutions:

  - **WS1: Technical Inter-connection of Existing LDTs** –  Linking and scaling digital twins or data platforms that are already in place
  - **WS2:  Creation of LDTs Based on Common Needs** – Addressing shared urban or regional challenges (e.g., cross-border traffic, air pollution).
  - **WS3: Adding New Advanced AI-Based Tools to the LDTs Toolbox** –  Integrating AI-driven, value-added services to enhance existing LDTs.

## Common Requirements

All calls will include a set of common requirements that applicants must meet in order to ensure the quality, interoperability, and sustainability of the pilots. These requirements are divided into technical, non-technical dimensions and general.  

**Technical:**  
1. The pilot demonstrates sufficient digital maturity (self-assessment survey).  
2. The pilot integrates interoperability by design from the start (not as an after-thought).  
3. Applicants commit to adopting a high level of interoperability, aligned with MIMs.  
4. Agree to use the global methodology by work strand, and to adapt them at their project.  

**Non-Technical:**  

<u>Financial:</u>  
5. Pilot applicants will have to cover **half of the project budget** (receiving approximately—depending on the project—between **€1.0–€1.5 million**).  

<u>Legal / Governance:</u>

<ol start="6">
  <li>To ensure interoperability by design:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Applicants must agree to integrate legal clauses regarding data sovereignty, the project being partly publicly funded, and the replicability and sustainability of results.</li>
      <li>Pilots will have a shared legal contract between entities.</li>
      <li>A clear statement of data governance status must be provided at both the beginning and the end of the project:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Pilots must describe a minimum level of data governance to get started.</li>
          <li>Pilots must propose a methodology for implementing their data governance.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Pilots must agree to share part of the project’s produced assets (e.g., data models, knowledge models, legal contracts, dashboards, visualisations, useful types of data, algorithms used to build dashboards, etc.).</li>
</ol>



**General:**  
8. The pilot consortium has familiarised themselves with the *priority areas of the European Green Deal* and *New European Bauhaus*; the project’s use cases *align* with them.  
9. Pilots must agree to *measure their socio-economic and environmental impact*; results will not be discriminatory for the project.  
10. The pilot follows a *cost-benefit analysis* with the provided tried-and-tested framework.  
11. *End-users are involved* from conception to roll-out (e.g., workshops or other means).  
12. The project has clear *positioning* regarding its *added value to the LDT4SSC ecosystem*.  
13. The pilot maintains *regular documentation, feedback, and updates* to the LDT4SSC consortium, contributing to a *common project Knowledge Hub*.  
14. The pilot follows the *LDT4SSC global methodology* and adapts it to their project—many methodological steps are to be followed for long-term sustainability (project-wise and environmentally-friendly) and reproducibility.  
15. In a European project about *digitalisation and sustainability*, pilots agree to *constantly question their reasoning*, asking “*what do I truly need for my use case—and to be frugal?*” at each new step.  

**Recommendations (Will Be Advantaged):**  
- Pilots who follow *eco-design guidelines* for the design of their platforms and services.  
- Pilots who *favour open access* to share the created *Key Expected Outcomes (services and assets)* of their projects.  
- Pilots who *involve end-users* from conception to roll-out.
