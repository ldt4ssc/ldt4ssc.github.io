# Pilot Guidance

This section provides an overview of the piloting process within **LDT4SSC** and provides guidelines and relevant resources for each of the Work Strands.

**Why to apply?**  
  Pilots are at the heart of LDT4SSC. They enable real-world testing of digital twin solutions, validate interoperability, and deliver tangible benefits for communities. Selected pilots will receive funding, technical and non-technical support, and visibility across the European Local Digital Twin ecosystem.  

**Work Strands (WS):**  
  The project foresees **three Work Strands**:  
  - **WS1: Interconnecting Existing LDTs** â€“ linking and scaling digital twins already in place.  
  - **WS2: Creating New LDTs Based on Common Needs** â€“ addressing shared urban or regional challenges (e.g. cross-border traffic, pollution).  
  - **WS3: Developing Advanced AI Services** â€“ adding AI-driven, value-added services to enhance LDTs.
