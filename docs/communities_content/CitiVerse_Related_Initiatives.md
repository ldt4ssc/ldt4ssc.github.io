The **Citiverse** extends Local Digital Twins into immersive, citizen-centric environments, blending metaverse technologies with urban data and services.  
These initiatives promote participatory governance, citizen engagement, and innovative service design.  

## LDT CitiVERSE EDIC  

![CitiVERSE EDIC Logo](../assets/citiverse_edic_logo.png){ width="280" align="center" }  
---  

**Short Description:**  
EDICs (European Digital Infrastructure Consortiums) are instruments made available to European Member States to speed up and simplify the setup and implementation of multi-country projects.  
The LDT CitiVERSE EDIC aims to build a shared European Digital Infrastructure and an ecosystem of services and innovators that accelerate the adoption and deployment of networked, interoperable, and reusable Local Digital Twins (LDTs) in European cities, communities, and regions.  

Based in Valencia (Spain), it currently involves 14 European Member States. Local and regional authorities can also become members.  

**Key role in the LDT Ecosystem:**  
As an official European Commission body, the LDT CitiVERSE EDIC will be the reference in deploying digital twins in Europe. It:  
- Maintains, develops, and provides members with the LDT Toolbox.  
- Co-creates training materials to directly support cities and communities.  
- Federates EU actors at national, regional, and local levels.  
- Labels and reassembles an ecosystem of service providers who advise, deploy, and assess interoperability, adding value to the ecosystem.  

**Relevance to LDT4SSC:**  
- Acts as a promoter of LDT4SSC activities.  
- Provides a policy-relevant link at EU level.

## X-Cite – Cross-Domain Digital Twin Ecosystem for Smart Cities  

![X-Cite Logo](../assets/xcite_logo.png){ width="160" align="center" }  
---  

**Short Description:**  
X-Cite is a European initiative focused on developing a cross-domain digital twin ecosystem for smart cities and communities. It creates a unified, interoperable, and scalable framework for LDTs, enabling seamless integration of urban data, AI models, and simulation tools across mobility, energy, environment, and public services.  

X-Cite aligns with EU policies (Digital Decade 2030, Data Governance Act, Green Deal) and supports EU standards (Gaia-X, FIWARE, NGSI-LD). It serves as a reference ecosystem for cities, businesses, and researchers, offering tools, methodologies, and best practices to accelerate adoption of LDTs in a standardized, ethical, and compliant way.  

**Key role in the LDT Ecosystem:**  
X-Cite supports the ecosystem by:  
- Providing a cross-domain framework for interoperable LDTs.  
- Supporting municipalities through standardized methodologies, governance models, and compliance guidelines.  
- Facilitating collaboration between public administrations, businesses, and researchers.  
- Ensuring alignment with EU data spaces (Gaia-X, FIWARE) and regulations (Data Governance Act, AI Act).  

**Relevance to LDT4SSC:**  
- Cross-Domain LDT Framework: Unified integration of mobility, energy, environment, and public services.  
- Standardized Methodologies and Tools: For data integration, AI modelling, and simulation.  
- Governance and Compliance: Ensures alignment with EU rules (Data Governance Act, AI Act, GDPR).  
- Real-World Pilots: Offers testing and validation environments for scalability and replicability.  
- Interoperability: Facilitates integration with EU data spaces for scalable deployments.  

**Key Assets and Resources:**
