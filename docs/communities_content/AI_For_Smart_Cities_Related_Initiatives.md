**Short Description:** As part of the [EU strategy for safe AI adoption](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/testing-and-experimentation-facilities), CitCom.ai (also referred to as CitComTEF) is a large-scale EU-funded project — a Testing and Experimentation Facility (TEF)— specifically tailored for AI and robotics in the domains of Smart Cities and Communities. It enables AI innovators, including SMEs and startups, to test and validate both software and hardware solutions in real environments before they’re deployed in urban settings.   At the same time, it allows cities to have a reference initiative when adopting data, AI, and Local Digital Twin (LDT) solutions, building upon relevant use-cases and having access to validated solutions from the AI innovators community.  
  
**Key role in the LDT Ecosystem:** CitCom.ai serves as a reference Testing and Experimentation Facility (TEF), supporting the safe, ethical, regulation-compliant, and interoperable deployment of AI in cities. It connects AI testing environments with Local Digital Twins (LDTs), providing a bridge between innovation and real-world deployment.   Within the LDT ecosystem, CitCom.ai acts as a key validation step for AI innovators aiming to join the marketplace of the [EU LDT Toolbox](https://living-in.eu/toolbox), ensuring successful and scalable integration into urban digital twins.  

**Relevance to LDT4SSC:**  
The initiative contributes directly to LDT4SSC by:  

- Supplying a [catalogue of AI Testing and Experimentation services](https://citcomtef.eu/services) relevant for smart communities.  

- Benchmarking AI and robotics market trends in the smart city domain ([Market report](https://citcomtef.eu/assets/uploads/Resources/D5.1-CitCom.ai-European-AI-Market-Report.pdf)), helping pilots and stakeholders align their solutions with market and regulatory needs.  

- Providing Testing and Experimentation Facilities ([TEFs](https://citcomai-hub.github.io/tef/)) where LDT pilots can test innovative services in realistic environments, ensuring scalability, replicability, and compliance with European policies and sustainability goals.  

- Offering a [reference common infrastructure](https://citcomai-hub.github.io/) supporting project operations across the technical domains of data spaces, data analytics, AI modelling, Local Digital Twins, and cybersecurity.

## Big Data Test Infrastructure (BDTI) – European Commission  

![BDTI Logo](../assets/bdti_logo.png){ width="230" align="center" }  
---  

**Short Description:**  
The Big Data Test Infrastructure (BDTI) is a European Commission initiative designed to provide testing, validation, and benchmarking for big data technologies, platforms, and applications. It supports Local Digital Twins (LDTs), smart cities, and data spaces by offering scalable, secure, and interoperable testing environments. BDTI aligns with EU policies such as the Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe, and the Data Governance Act, and enables public administrations, businesses, and researchers to validate big data solutions in compliance with EU standards (e.g., Gaia-X, FIWARE, NGSI-LD). It is complemented by training, certification, and community engagement programmes, and validates its strategies through pilot projects in European cities and regions, engaging public administrations, SMEs, and research organisations.  

**Key role in the LDT Ecosystem:**  
BDTI plays a critical role in the LDT ecosystem by providing a testing and validation framework for big data technologies. It ensures compliance, scalability, and interoperability of LDT deployments, and supports cross-sector collaboration (e.g., mobility, energy, environment) through standardized testing environments. By aligning with EU policies (e.g., Digital Decade 2030, Data Governance Act), it builds legal compliance and trust into LDT projects while also facilitating innovation and funding by connecting projects to European programmes.  

**Relevance to LDT4SSC:**  
The initiative contributes directly to LDT4SSC by:  

- Providing a testing and validation framework for big data in LDTs, ensuring interoperability and compliance.  
- Supporting cross-domain collaborationvacross mobility, energy, and environment sectors.  
- Ensuring compliance with EU regulations (e.g., GDPR, Data Governance Act), reducing risks for cities and communities.  
- Facilitating innovation and scalability by linking LDT pilots with EU programmes (Horizon Europe, Digital Europe).  

**Key Assets and Resources:**  
[[BDTI Policy Overview](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/bdti), [BDTI Knowledge Base](https://living-in.eu/knowledge-base bdti-big-data-test-infrastructure-european-public-administrations), [BDTI Github](https://code.europa.eu/bdti)]
