**Short Description:**  
DS4SSCC (Data Space for Smart and Sustainable Cities and Communities) is a flagship EU initiative aimed at establishing a **federated, territorial, and cross-sectoral data space** for smart and sustainable cities and communities. It aligns with the **European Green Deal** and **Digital Decade** objectives, focusing on **data governance, interoperability, and shared value creation**.  

It develops a **multi-stakeholder governance scheme** (quadruple helix: public, private, academic, citizens) and a **European data space blueprint** covering technical, organizational, and legal frameworks. The blueprint is validated through **10–12 cross-sectoral pilots** in EU communities, using high-value datasets.  

The initiative also promotes **data reuse** and minimizes infrastructure investment by:  
- Co-creating use cases and functional requirements.  
- Developing **technical standards** (MIMs, DCAT, FIWARE).  
- Establishing **governance frameworks** (code of conduct, participation agreements).  
- Deploying **local pilots** to refine the blueprint.  
- Offering a **Training Hub** for data space newcomers.  

**Key role in the LDT Ecosystem:**  
DS4SSCC enables Local Digital Twins (LDTs) by providing:  
- A **federated data infrastructure** for secure, sovereign, and interoperable data sharing.  
- **Standardized data models** (MIMs, Smart Data Models, FIWARE) essential for LDTs and urban platforms.  
- **Multi-stakeholder governance frameworks** aligned with EU values.  
- Tools to support the **green and digital transition**, including tracking and reporting toward carbon neutrality and sustainable mobility.  

**Relevance to LDT4SSC:**  
The initiative contributes directly to LDT4SSC by:  

- Offering the [DS4SSCC Toolbox](https://toolbox.dssc.eu/) and Training Hub for cities deploying LDTs.  
- Providing the **technical and organizational blueprint** ([DS4SSCC Blueprint](https://www.ds4sscc.eu/inventory)) to create local data spaces that connect to LDTs.  
- Enabling pilots to generate **standardized datasets** reusable by LDTs for simulations and analytics.  
- Ensuring **legal and ethical compliance** through governance frameworks and codes of conduct.  
- Reducing **costs and carbon footprints** by promoting data reuse and shared infrastructure.
