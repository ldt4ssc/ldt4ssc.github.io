## Example stories
To illustrate the potential of each WS, we present a set of Pilots’ Example Stories, i.e. fictional scenarios that demonstrate how future pilots could emerge and operate within the LDT4SSC project framework. These examples are intended to help prospective applicants envision their own roles and opportunities within the initiative.

The example stories developed for WS1 show how cities and communities with an existing level of digital maturity (as described in the Requirements section) can build on their Local LDTs to form a federated, EU-wide ecosystem. Each example illustrates how interoperability, cross-border collaboration, and shared data platforms can enable scalable and replicable solutions. The realistic use cases highlight the concrete benefits of interconnected LDTs, such as improved decision-making, resource optimisation, and faster adoption of open-source tools, while also addressing common challenges like technical integration, governance, and stakeholder coordination. Their purpose is to inspire replication, lower entry barriers for less digitally advanced regions, and foster a shared community of practice around federated LDTs, advancing the project’s goal of a unified and interoperable digital infrastructure for Europe.


???+ example "Traffic Management and Air Quality"

    Two municipalities of similar size, population, and density have each developed a descriptive Local Digital Twin (LDT) to monitor traffic, air quality, and their interaction. They partner with a specialised private service provider to interconnect their systems and exchange data and related services using the NGSI-LD standard. By linking their context brokers, the partners establish a shared real-time dashboard that enables coordinated management of transport corridors and supports efforts to reduce congestion and pollution.

    To ensure seamless data and service interoperability, the partners align their API documentation with the MIM1. The outcomes include both operational improvements such as optimised traffic flows and reduced emissions, and reusable assets such as standardised data models and dashboards that can be adopted by other cities.

    This example reflects the ambition of WS1: to scale up EU-wide datasets and open-source solutions within the LDT ecosystem, demonstrating how federated approaches can transform local innovations into collective impact.

???+ example "Interconnected Networks Management and Service Marketplace"

    Cities of a DS4SSCC Pilot projects interconnect their Local Digital Twins (LDTs) with those of another group of communities to create a shared marketplace for essential public services, aligned with the priorities of each local authority. These services may include areas such as mobility, land-use planning, and energy or electricity management, reflecting the themes of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and the European Green Deal. By leveraging the SIMPL building blocks and the FIWARE ecosystem of technologies, this new consortium integrates waste, energy, and water management systems, enabling local authority syndicates to exchange data, optimise resource allocation, and deliver new services across regions. The main challenge lies in ensuring the maturity of the connector, which must reliably bridge diverse platforms while maintaining data consistency and security.

    The outcomes include operational efficiencies such as streamlined network management and cross-city service coordination, as well as contributions to the SIMPL framework, reinforcing its role as means for interoperable LDT ecosystems. This example illustrates how federated LDTs can move beyond individual city silos, fostering a collaborative economy of shared services and scalable, cross-regional solutions.

???+ example annotate "Regional Energy and Climate Data Space"

    Several municipalities in a cross-border region with varying digital maturity levels create a shared DS to combine energy production and consumption data. The goal is to monitor regional energy use and evaluate its climate impact. Together with a data space specialist and a local energy supplier, the municipalities deploy a FIWARE Data Space Connector and use the EU LDT Toolbox to model scenarios on energy demand, renewable integration, and the environmental impact of alternative energy sources. The main challenge is to manage data access rights among diverse stakeholders (municipalities, regional alliances, and private partners) while ensuring secure data exchange and consistent decision-making across governance levels.

    The project delivers a real-time regional overview of energy supply and demand, enabling policymakers, businesses, and citizens to track consumption patterns and make informed choices. It demonstrates how federated LDTs can consolidate fragmented local data into a unified, actionable resource for advancing climate resilience and the energy transition.

- The data lifecycle, and the action plan for accessing and using the data effectively

---

### Prototyping (DEFINE) {#prototyping-define}

Prototyping turns a theoretical concept into a tangible proof of feasibility. Rather than building a finished service, this phase focuses on rapidly testing a solution on a limited scope, using real data and confronting assumptions with technical, functional, and human realities. While not always mandatory—especially if existing market solutions already fit the need—prototyping often provides valuable insights before large-scale deployment. Its purpose is twofold: to show that the idea works and to confirm that it brings real value to users. This iterative, frugal approach enables quick learning while preparing the foundations for a scalable deployment.

📋 **Prerequisites**

- A prioritised and formalised use case validated internally
- Clear functional and technical specifications
- Identified and accessible datasets in usable form
- Identified human and technical resources to build the prototype
- Agreement from a small group of end-users to test the solution under semi-real conditions

🎯 **Objectives**

- Experiment with concrete solutions using real data and representative users
- Validate organisational hypotheses
- Confirm technical feasibility (data access, processing, flow integration, result display, etc.)
- Confirm or refine design choices based on practical feedback
- Prepare the conditions for future deployment (technical, organisational, legal)

👥 **Stakeholders to Engage**

- A project manager
- Business referents to test and validate functionalities
- A data engineer or developer to integrate data and build the prototype
- A UX/UI designer or facilitator (if possible) to ensure clear user journeys
- An IT or infrastructure consultant to ensure compatibility with the existing environment and support implementation

- A prototype that meets the use case
- Reusable knowledge model(s)
- The code used to produce the algorithms or models
- Documentation of the prototype

---

### Deployment (IMPLEMENT) {#deployment-implement}

Deployment marks the transition from experimentation to full implementation. Once the prototype has demonstrated feasibility, the goal becomes widespread adoption across the organisation. This phase focuses on stabilising and securing the solution, establishing maintenance processes, and ensuring long-term sustainability. It also finalises the technical architecture, economic model, and legal framework, while preparing an action plan for training, onboarding, and organisational change. Ideally, many of these topics will have been explored earlier; this stage formalises and operationalises them. Deployment may also open opportunities for scaling, replication, or pooling with other local authorities.

📋 **Prerequisites**

- A prototype validated by target users and tested in near-real conditions
- A political or strategic decision to make the solution sustainable
- A defined target technical architecture (hosting, tools, security, interconnections)
- An analysis of implementation and maintenance costs
- A clear vision for the future governance of the solution (technical, organisational, partnership)


🎯 **Objectives**

- Establish governance for the data and service (updating, sharing, accountability)
- Choose an appropriate management structure where relevant
- Organise maintenance, support, and long-term evolution of the solution
- Technically stabilise the solution for production use
- Ensure user adoption through training and ongoing adjustments
- Document and capitalise on lessons learned to support reuse internally or externally


👥 **Stakeholders to Engage**

- The business department responsible for the project, to steer deployment and support adoption
- IT/digital teams to integrate the solution into the existing information system
- Functional managers to monitor user feedback and prioritise improvements
- External service providers for industrialisation, hosting, and technical support
- Public purchasers and legal experts to formalise contracts and clarify rights of use and ownership
- Potential partner local authorities for pooling or scaling initiatives
