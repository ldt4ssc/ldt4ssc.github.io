Incremental expansion of services and applications, guided by a coherent strategy and supported by an interoperable technical backbone, enables communities to create and capture value throughout the ongoing development process. To ensure accountability and shared learning, the value of LDTs should be measured against well-defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) linked to the original goals, with results (both successes and setbacks) communicated across current stakeholders and potential collaborators.  </p> <p>As with any digital transformation journey, trust and value creation are essential. Governance should therefore engage diverse stakeholders across the quadruple helix (public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society), supported by strong leadership to align digital infrastructure and data-driven collaboration with community-wide strategies.

When authorities align LDTs with public values and involve communities early on, they build trust and ensure the technology serves the public good.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Civil Society Organisations (CSOs): NGOs and community groups gain a powerful data-driven tool for advocacy and collaboration with authorities and citizens. CSOs can monitor policy impacts (e.g., on the environment, social equity, accessibility), raise issues early, and co-develop solutions.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Technology Providers: Local and Regional Authorities often procure LDTs from tech firms (software developers, platform vendors, sensor manufacturers, etc.). This creates new markets, enables technology demonstration with city data, and builds stronger business cases.

These examples are intended to help prospective applicants envision their own roles and opportunities within the initiative.</p> <p>The example stories developed for WS1 show how cities and communities with an existing level of digital maturity (as described in the Requirements section) can build on their Local LDTs to form a federated, EU-wide ecosystem. Each example illustrates how interoperability, cross-border collaboration, and shared data platforms can enable scalable and replicable solutions. The realistic use cases highlight the concrete benefits of interconnected LDTs, such as improved decision-making, resource optimisation, and faster adoption of open-source tools, while also addressing common challenges like technical integration, governance, and stakeholder coordination. Their purpose is to inspire replication, lower entry barriers for less digitally advanced regions, and foster a shared community of practice around federated LDTs, advancing the project\u2019s goal of a unified and interoperable digital infrastructure for Europe.</p> Traffic Management and Air Quality <p>Two municipalities of similar size, population, and density have each developed a descriptive Local Digital Twin (LDT) to monitor traffic, air quality, and their interaction. They partner with a specialised private service provider to interconnect their systems and exchange data and related services using the NGSI-LD standard. By linking their context brokers, the partners establish a shared real-time dashboard that enables coordinated management of transport corridors and supports efforts to reduce congestion and pollution.</p> <p>To ensure seamless data and service interoperability, the partners align their API documentation with the MIM1. The outcomes include both operational improvements such as optimised traffic flows and reduced emissions, and reusable assets such as standardised data models and dashboards that can be adopted by other cities.</p> <p>This example reflects the ambition of WS1: to scale up EU-wide datasets and open-source solutions within the LDT ecosystem, demonstrating how federated approaches can transform local innovations into collective impact.</p> Interconnected Networks Management and Service Marketplace <p>Cities of a DS4SSCC Pilot projects interconnect their Local Digital Twins (LDTs) with those of another group of communities to create a shared marketplace for essential public services, aligned with the priorities of each local authority. These services may include areas such as mobility, land-use planning, and energy or electricity management, reflecting the themes of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and the European Green Deal. By leveraging the SIMPL building blocks and the FIWARE ecosystem of technologies, this new consortium integrates waste, energy, and water management systems, enabling local authority syndicates to exchange data, optimise resource allocation, and deliver new services across regions. The main challenge lies in ensuring the maturity of the connector, which must reliably bridge diverse platforms while maintaining data consistency and security.</p> <p>The outcomes include operational efficiencies such as streamlined network management and cross-city service coordination, as well as contributions to the SIMPL framework, reinforcing its role as means for interoperable LDT ecosystems. This example illustrates how federated LDTs can move beyond individual city silos, fostering a collaborative economy of shared services and scalable, cross-regional solutions.</p> Regional Energy and Climate Data Space <p>Several municipalities in a cross-border region with varying digital maturity levels create a shared DS to combine energy production and consumption data. The goal is to monitor regional energy use and evaluate its climate impact. Together with a data space specialist and a local energy supplier, the municipalities deploy a FIWARE Data Space Connector and use the EU LDT Toolbox to model scenarios on energy demand, renewable integration, and the environmental impact of alternative energy sources. The main challenge is to manage data access rights among diverse stakeholders (municipalities, regional alliances, and private partners) while ensuring secure data exchange and consistent decision-making across governance levels.</p> <p>The project delivers a real-time regional overview of energy supply and demand, enabling policymakers, businesses, and citizens to track consumption patterns and make informed choices. It demonstrates how federated LDTs can consolidate fragmented local data into a unified, actionable resource for advancing climate resilience and the energy transition.</p>"},{"location":"resources_content/non_tech_resources/#the-ldt4ssc-methodology","title":"\ud83d\udcd6 The LDT4SSC Methodology","text":"Use Case 4.

The project integrated the city\u2019s software infrastructure, managing large amounts of data from different sources, such as geographical information systems, satellite images, IoT sensors, etc. The use of Smart Data Models allowed for semantic interoperability, while the use of a context broker allowed for the integration of the orchestration onto the NGSI-LD standards. The result was a system compliant with the European standards, that transformed the city\u2019s digital infrastructure enabling a participatory and integrated approach to facilitate decision-making.</p> <p>In addition to the Smart Data Models, WiseTown used an NGSI-LD-compliant context broker, Orion-LD, chosen as the messaging and context information manager. For security infrastructure, the solution was FIWARE\u2019s Keyrock. Used for a wide range of IoT Agents, the FIWARE IDAS solution was also adopted. Figure 8 provides a high-level overview of the adopted architecture, while Figure 7 shows a unifying decision-making dashboard that resulted from this collaboration. </p> <p>The decision to rely on FIWARE resources and NGSI-LD standard allowed for the integration of heterogeneous data (GIS, IoT, registers, third-party applications), as well as the implementation of a standardised and documented API. It created an interoperable platform aligned with European recommendations, promoting reuse and scalability. Several use-cases have been deployed, including: mobility and parking (real-time monitoring of traffic and parking space availability); environment and quality of life (monitoring of air pollution levels, noise pollution and public lighting); green space management (data monitoring to improve planning and maintenance); energy optimisation (management scenarios for public lighting or the integration of renewable energies); citizen participation (mobile applications and crowd-planning tools enabling residents to report problems, monitor their resolution and contribute to development projects).</p> <p>What makes Perugia's experience particularly remarkable is its ability, as a medium-sized city, to mobilise interoperable infrastructure and implement inter-municipal data governance.

With the rise in population, it recognised the need for innovative city planning, incorporating recent technological tools in its existing planning support systems. To go beyond static planning, with limited participation and capacity for adaptations, the city launched the Digital Twin of Zurich. It consists of a dynamic 3D spatial model to support evidence-based decision making. The twin integrates real-time data, 3D models, and analytical tools to enable the simulation of urban phenomena, such as climate impacts, densification, and mobility.</p> <p>The twin evolved from Zurich\u2019s 3D City Model, initially developed in 2011 and managed by the city\u2019s GIS department. The model encompasses detailed topography, buildings, bridges, vegetation, in various levels of detail. These datasets formed the base for further data integration, for instance linking cadastral, environmental, and planning information under a governance framework aligned with Switzerland\u2019s Federal Act on Geoinformation (GeoIG). The local government also made the data publicly available in the city\u2019s Geoportal, and an interactive visualisation of the twin\u2019s components is done by the means of Zurich Virtuell.</p> <p>Zurich\u2019s digital twin has enabled integration of several planning domains. It supports the Municipal Development Plan, showing the current building development, the allowed development, and possible scenarios; urban climate analysis, modelling airflow and heat mitigation strategies; or even architectural competitions, where Augmented Reality (AR) and web-based tools are planned to allow juries to assess digital submissions interactively. Moreover, participatory initiatives were also put in place, such as \u201cMinecraft Zurich\u201d, which allows citizens to design and submit their own ideas, lowering barriers to political participation.</p> <p>Zurich's example exemplifies a mature, multi-purpose data platform for data-driven urban governance. It combines spatial accuracy and open access principles, enhancing the city's ability to simulate, visualise, and discuss planning scenarios, with the collaboration of the population. Further developments envisioned by the city include bettering their interconnected 3D data, with faster updating for instance; systematic recording of urban furniture; better interconnection of BIM and GIS world; building a 3D utility cadaster, among others. The Zurich example demonstrates how a data platform can evolve towards a fully-fledged digital twin, with an operational decision-support system, allowing citizen participation to foster sustainable urban growth.</p> Differdange (LU): clean energy and mobility <p>The city of Differdange, in Luxembourg, is well-known for its industrial heritage and green spaces, and actively pursues net-zero carbon emissions through innovative renewable energy initiatives. In the fields of energy and mobility, LIST in collaboration with the city\u2019s experts in the context of the CitCom.ai project have developed an LDT aiming at integrating electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and renewable energy generation. More specifically, the LDT leverages information on charging points, buildings, and solar panels. Understanding the balance between renewable energy production and energy demand in charging stations is essential for the city\u2019s sustainability goals. The implementation includes data collection and telemetry emulators, spatio-temporal and graph databases, DT cloud solutions, and interactive maps and dashboards. Several analytical models were produced from the integrated data, and are used to both produce synthetic telemetry, and predict telemetry depending on the parameters in a simulation. </p> <p>The current effort of the Differdange LDT is in the direction of adopting interoperable, open-source solutions, in-line with the resources presented in this document. This is intended to increase their adherence to the MIMs Plus framework. For that to happen, the team is currently producing a gap analysis, to assess how far the current implementation is from an interoperable one, possible to be connected to a data space, to be further integrated with other solutions and assets. The first step forward is the adoption of a NGSI-LD-compliant context broker, particularly from the ones cited in this document (Stellio, Orion-LD, Scorpio). Secondly, to make their data interoperable, they plan to adopt domain-specific ontologies from the Smart Data Models framework. More specifically, they are looking into the Buildings data model from the Smart Cities framework, as well as the Photovoltaic Device and the Photovoltaic Measurement from the Smart Energy one. In their case, the effort is not to have a virtualisation layer to transform the data, but to actually overhaul the data structure.</p> <p>The example implementation of Differdange shows a working LDT that currently caters to the city and its partners\u2019 sustainability efforts. It already provides an impressive level of insights on current and future trends of sustainable energy production and EV charging demands. It nonetheless recognises the importance of interoperability, and the team is actively pursuing a stricter compliance to standards and frameworks that allows for further interconnection. This could help not only the city\u2019s officials and their citizens in the delivery of a more accurate service, but other initiatives throughout Europe that might undergo similar kinds of societal challenges and could leverage from the collective learning this experience has brought about.</p> Antibes (FR): an indoor descriptive Local Digital Twin with 3D implementation <p>In enclosed spaces, indoor air quality is greatly affected by carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) levels, which play an important role in the comfort and health of occupants. Excessively high CO\u2082 concentrations can cause symptoms such as fatigue, headaches and difficulty concentrating, as well as unpleasant odours. In addition, local or national regulations may require an assessment of ventilation systems and the implementation of pollutant control measures by an accredited body or self-assessment.. Continuous measurement of CO2 concentration is recommended in support of this decree in order to reduce health risks and increase occupant comfort.</p> <p>To reduce CO2 levels, temperature, relative humidity, and levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO, allergens and fungi in enclosed spaces, the most effective solution is natural ventilation by opening windows and doors to create a draught. Concerned about the well-being of its teachers and pupils, Antibes Town Hall (Logistics and Education Departments) and EGM have therefore equipped the teaching and living spaces at the Jean Moulin School with sensors that continuously measure CO2 levels, temperature and relative humidity.</p> <p>A total of 30 Nexelec Carbon sensors were deployed in 14 primary classrooms, 6 nursery classrooms, 1 activity room, 2 dormitories and 1 large dining hall. They are connected to the Orange LoRaWAN network, and the data collected is then centralised on an EGM TWIN\u00b7PICKS platform (FIWARE architecture with Stelio context broker)  where, among other things, the school air confinement index (ICONE) is calculated to assess the degree of air confinement in a room. This is based on continuous CO2 measurement over a school week at 10-minute intervals and calculated exclusively for periods when the room is occupied.</p> <p>The city of Antibes, which has a 3D representation of its territory, wanted to feed the ICONE index information into this representation, thereby enabling better visualisation of the data and creating a digital twin of the territory. To do this, the temporal data is retrieved directly from the NGSI-LD API by the 3D visualisation tools Terra Explorer and C\u00e9sium.</p>"},{"location":"resources_content/tech_resources/#reference-architecture","title":"Reference architecture","text":"<p>We provide a possible high-level architecture implementation for achieving the desired interconnection between existing LDTs, scope of WS1.

In case the connection is done via a data space, a data space connector must be deployed (unless using a SIMPL Agent, which includes an EDC connector). This allows other consumers or providers to be onboarded on the same data space, ensuring access policies and also interacting with the interconnected LDTs, guaranteeing a sustainable interoperable environment.</p>"},{"location":"resources_content/tech_resources/#technical-resource-library","title":"\ud83d\udcda Technical Resource Library","text":"<p>How to use this library</p> <p>Filter resources by Layer, MIMs Plus category, and Scope.
